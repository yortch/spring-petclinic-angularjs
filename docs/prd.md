# Pet Clinic Management System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Feature Name

**Pet Clinic Management System** - A comprehensive web-based veterinary clinic management platform for managing pets, owners, veterinarians, and medical visits.

## 2. Epic

**Epic Name:** Veterinary Clinic Operations Management  
**Description:** A complete digital solution for veterinary clinics to efficiently manage their daily operations, including pet registration, owner management, veterinarian directory, and medical visit tracking. This system replaces manual record-keeping with a modern, user-friendly web application that streamlines clinic workflows and improves patient care coordination.

## 3. Goal

### Problem
Veterinary clinics traditionally rely on paper-based systems or outdated software to manage patient records, owner information, and appointment histories. This leads to several challenges:
- Inefficient data retrieval and storage leading to longer wait times
- Difficulty in tracking pet medical history and previous visits
- Challenges in maintaining accurate owner contact information
- Limited ability to quickly access veterinarian specialties and availability
- Risk of data loss and inconsistent record-keeping

### Solution
The Pet Clinic Management System provides a centralized, web-based platform that digitalizes all clinic operations. The system enables clinic staff to quickly register new pets and owners, maintain comprehensive medical records, track visit histories, and access veterinarian information with specialized skills. Built with modern web technologies (Spring Boot REST API with AngularJS frontend), the system offers real-time data access, robust data persistence, and an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training.
