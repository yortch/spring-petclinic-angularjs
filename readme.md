# AngularJS and Spring Boot version of the Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angularjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angularjs/)

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
[See the presentation here](http://fr.slideshare.net/AntoineRey/spring-framework-petclinic-sample-application)

## Running petclinic locally
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angularjs.git
cd spring-petclinic-angularjs
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl spring-petclinic-server
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angularjs/issues

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setups is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
To run petclinic locally using MySQL database, it is needed to change profile defined in the  application.properties` file.

For MySQL database, it is needed to switch profile. There is two ways:

1. Update application properties: open the `application.properties` file, then change the value `hsqldb` to `mysql`
2. Use a Spring Boot JVM parameter: simply start the JVM with the `-Dspring.profiles.active=mysql.prod` parameter.


Before do this, it would be good to change JDBC url properties defined in the `application-mysql.properties` file:

```
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/petclinic?useUnicode=true
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=petclinic 
```      

The `localhost` host should be set for a MySQL dabase instance started on your local machine.
You may also start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run --name mysql-petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7
```


## Docker

### Run an image

To run a Docker image of Petclinic with its embedded HSQL database, you may 

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t --name springboot-petclinic arey/springboot-petclinic
```

If you want to use MySQL, you first have to change the `spring.datasource.url` declared in the `application-mysql.properties` file.
You have to rebuild the image (see next section).
Then you could activated the `mysql` profile:

```
docker run -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mysql,prod" -p 8080:8080 -t --name springboot-petclinic arey/springboot-petclinic
```

### Use Docker Compose

The simplest way is to use docker-compose

```
docker-compose up
```

### Build an image

To rebuild a Docker image on your device:
```
./mvnw clean install
cd spring-petclinic-server
mvn clean package docker:build
```

To publish a new image into Docker Hub:
```
mvn clean package docker:build -DpushImageTag
```

## Working with Petclinic in Eclipse/STS

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/installation.html)
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/


### Steps:

1) In the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```

### Active the dev Spring profile

In development mode, we recommand you yo use the ```dev``` Spring profile.
Just add the following VM option:
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```
All static resources changes will be monitored by the embedded LiveReload server of Spring Boot Devtools.
See [application-dev.properties](spring-petclinic-server/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties) for details.

## Client-side Architecture

Compared to the [standard Petclinic based on JSP pages](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic), 
this SpringBoot AngularJS Petclinic is splitted in 2 modules - a client module and a server module:
* spring-petclinic-client : static resources (images, fonts, style, angular JS code) packaged as a webjar.
* spring-petclinic-server : Spring MVC REST API and an index.html template

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-angularjs][] project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
